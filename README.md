# Video Conferencing App

A modern, feature-rich video conferencing application built with React, LiveKit, and Mantine UI. This application provides real-time video, audio, screen sharing, and chat capabilities with a clean, responsive interface.

The chief advantage of this platform is that it can be self hosted in docker or
on a VM, or even on your own gear.  No need for teams/slack/whatever licenses
and paying subscriptions.  

## Reasons you might want to do this:

- Security - being self hosted means your data never leaves your infrastructure (unless you want it to)
- Flexibility - The UI and backend are simply a "starting point" you can integrate with any tools/technologies you want.
- Cost - this can be debatable...it "might" be cheaper, it really depends on what you're trying to do with it.  Certainly for smaller shops, it's likely cheaper to self host this on inexpensive VMs/hardware and just use the cloud livekit signalling servers, at a certain level of scale though you'll want to reinvestigate this decision.  If  you have sysadmins and infrastructure that is underutilized, this might be a very compelling solution.

## Reasons you might NOT want to do this:
- you think you're going to save money, but have not technical expertise... Unless your time is worth nothing, it's quite likely this will be much more expensive as you'll need the engineering expertise to make it all work together.
- you already have a solution that meets your needs and you don't need/want more security/customization/data governance capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI Framework**: Mantine UI
- **Video/Audio**: LiveKit (WebRTC)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- LiveKit server (can be self-hosted or cloud)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd video
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment example
cp server/env.example server/.env

# Edit server/.env with your LiveKit credentials
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 4. Generate SSL Certificates (Optional if you want encryption with a self signed certificate)
```bash
./generate-ssl.sh
```

### 5. Start the Application
```bash
# Development mode (Express server with embedded Vite)
npm run dev

# Alternative: Run client and server separately
npm run dev:separate

# Production mode
npm run build
npm run start --workspace=server
```

### 6. Access the Application
- **HTTP**: http://localhost:3001
- **HTTPS**: https://localhost:3001 (if SSL certificates are generated)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Server (.env)
```env
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Client (.env)
```env
VITE_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-server.com
VITE_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/api/token
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### LiveKit Server Setup
1. Deploy a LiveKit server (self-hosted or cloud)
2. Get your API key and secret from LiveKit Cloud or your server
3. Update the environment variables with your LiveKit server details

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera/Microphone Not Working**
   - Ensure browser permissions are granted
   - Check if devices are connected and working
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify LiveKit server is running
   - Check environment variables are correct
   - Ensure network connectivity

3. **Mobile Issues**
