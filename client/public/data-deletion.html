  <h1>Data Deletion Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: January 1, 2024</p>
  <p>
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Our video conferencing application is designed so that we do <strong>not</strong> store any user data beyond what is necessary for the operation of the service.
  </p>

  <h2>No Persistent User Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store your personal information, chat history, or video/audio content after your session ends.</li>
    <li>Authentication information (such as your name or email from Google or Facebook) is used only for the duration of your session and is not retained.</li>
    <li>Temporary data required for the operation of the service is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Request Data Deletion</h2>
